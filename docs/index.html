            <p>Objective-C is a dynamic message passing
            object-oriented programming language. The language adds a
            minimal number of features and few syntactic constructs on
            top of standard C. Thus, every C program is a valid
            Objective-C program and any existing C code or library can
            be integrated without modification and without using
            cumbersome foreign function interfaces.</p>

            <p>The most powerful features of Objective-C are message
            passing and dynamic dispatch. With these features, it is
            possible to design object-oriented systems that do not
            require decomposition into strict hierarchies. So an
            application need not define abstract base classes that do
            not make semantic sense nor do objects need to explicitly
            declare that they conform to an interface.</p>

            <p>Consider a page layout application used in the printing
            industry. Such an application displays graphics and text
            and provides actions a user can perform on the
            objects.</p>
